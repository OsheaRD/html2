    This example is about making lists
    Here's what I like about lists:

    <UL>  
    They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
     That's about it
         I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
              When you make a list, do it in this order:

     </UL>

<ol>
<Li> Decide if it's an ordered list or not</Li>
<Li>  If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</Li>
<Li>  Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</Li>
<Li>  Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</Li>
<Li>  You've got this, I believe in you!</Li>
</ol>
